## Scottish Government Accelerator Program (August-December 2019)

This was a Scottish Government collaborative project aimed at mentoring George Mitchell (Assistant Economist at The Scottish Government) to process financial tax data from a variety of sources, and then display it interactively using a Shiny app.


## DataFest Social Network Analysis (May-August 2019)

This project is part of The Data Lab's [industry placement program](https://www.thedatalab.com/what-we-do/skills-and-training/the-data-lab-msc), where a data science MSc student will carry out supervised research as part of an internship with an organisation. For [this project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qruOZNnQ3I), I managed [Jack Tacchi's](http://thelearnjourn.com/) work on dynamic social networks, to see whether changes over time in a particular Twitter network may be related to KPIs such as ticket sales for events.


## Scottish Government Accelerator Program (April-September 2018)

This was a Scottish Government collaborative project, open to employees of the Scottish Government who sought to improve their data skills. I mentored one of the applicants as part of this initiative - Maite Thrower (Senior Analyst from Public Health Intelligence, ISD within NHS / National Services Scotland), and supervised her while learning to create interactive visualisations of medical data.
