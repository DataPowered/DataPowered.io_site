## Background

I am a data & research enthusiast working as Principal Data Consultant at [GlobalLogic](https://www.globallogic.com/uk/). My previous roles have included (Senior) Data Scientist at [Vuzo](https://vuzo.co.uk/), [Tesco Bank](https://www.tescobank.com/) and [The Data Lab Innovation Centre](https://www.thedatalab.com/).

I am widely interested in data analysis, visualisation and manipulation - which I've applied across a variety of domains: national health data, occupational therapy, [transport](http://edinbr.org/edinbr/2018/06/15/may-meeting-extra-ShinyAppCode.html), data for good, [tourism](https://www.meetup.com/Newcastle-Upon-Tyne-Data-Science-Meetup/events/257156380/), housing and online retail (for a furniture manufacturer). 

My academic background is in psychology, emotion and research methods, and includes a PhD in Psychology awarded by The University of Edinburgh with no corrections. At the time, my doctoral research investigated if various emotion-generating stimuli used in lab settings (including VR & the [Oculus Rift DK1](https://vr-compare.com/headset/oculusriftdk1)) could approximate emotional states occurring in daily life, as measured using a bespoke [Android phone app](https://github.com/CaterinaC/Android_App). As part of my doctoral research I also tested if [model-based cluster analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mclust/vignettes/mclust.html) can serve as a computational model for how humans create (fuzzy) emotional categories. 

Previously, I have also been heavily involved with community events in the area of data science: I have organised [DataTech19](https://www.datafest.global/data-tech) and planned DataTech20; I have also organised the [Edinburgh R meetup](https://www.meetup.com/EdinbR/) ([EdinbR](http://edinbr.org/)) for a number of years.
