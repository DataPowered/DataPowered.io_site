## Community engagement 

* Previously (end of 2015 - Nov 2019), I have organised the [EdinbR meetup](https://www.meetup.com/EdinbR/) (check out [the site](http://edinbr.org/) for details). EdinbR speakers during this time have included [Hadley Wickham](http://edinbr.org/edinbr/2016/05/11/may-Hadley-Update2-PostingTalk.html) and [David Robinson](http://edinbr.org/edinbr/2018/02/01/february-meeting-David-Robinson.html).
* For my community engagement, data skills and commitment to data science work, I was awarded the New Talent [DataIQ award](https://www.dataiq.co.uk/articles/articles/dataiq-awards-2019---new-talent-caterina-constantinescu-data-scientist-the-data-lab) (July 2019)
* [SatRday Newcastle](https://newcastle2019.satrdays.org/) conference co-organiser (April 2019)
* [DataTech](https://www.datafest.global/data-tech) conference chair (March 2019)
