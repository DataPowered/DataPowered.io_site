### DataFest Social Network Analysis (May-August 2019)

This project is part of The Data Lab's [industry placement program](https://www.thedatalab.com/what-we-do/skills-and-training/the-data-lab-msc), where a data science MSc student will carry out supervised research as part of an internship with an organisation. For this project, I will be managing Jack Tacchi's work on dynamic social networks, to see whether changes over time in a particular Twitter network may be related to KPIs such as ticket sales for events.


### Scottish Government Accelerator Program (April-September 2018)

This was a Scottish Government collaborative project, open to employees of the Scottish Government who sought to improve their data skills. I mentored one of the applicants as part of this initiative - Maite Thrower (Senior Analyst from Public Health Intelligence, ISD within NHS / National Services Scotland), and supervised her while learning to create interactive visualisations of medical data.
