### Background

<img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5103AQHgilVR7xkvTg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0?e=1597881600&v=beta&t=qgGCHUu-m719sINM0b7seb2HiafJNtV2UR3aJJf-GLw" width="225" style="float: left; margin-right: 25px;" />I am a data & research enthusiast working as Data Scientist at [Tesco Bank](https://www.tescobank.com/), following a few years of work as Data Scientist at [The Data Lab Innovation Centre](https://www.thedatalab.com/). 

I am widely interested in data analysis, visualisation and manipulation - which I've applied across a variety of domains: national health data, occupational therapy, [transport](http://edinbr.org/edinbr/2018/06/15/may-meeting-extra-ShinyAppCode.html), data for good, [tourism](https://www.meetup.com/Newcastle-Upon-Tyne-Data-Science-Meetup/events/257156380/), and KPI monitoring/internal strategic planning. 

My academic background is in psychology, emotion and research methods. I have completed my PhD at The University of Edinburgh, investigating if various emotion-generating stimuli used in lab settings could approximate emotional states occurring in daily life (as measured using a bespoke [Android phone app](https://github.com/CaterinaC/Android_App)). As part of my doctoral research, I also tested if [model-based cluster analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mclust/vignettes/mclust.html) can serve as a computational model for how humans create (fuzzy) emotional categories. 

Lastly, I have also been heavily involved with community events in the area of data science: I have organised [DataTech19](https://www.datafest.global/data-tech) and planned DataTech20; I have also organised the [Edinburgh R meetup](https://www.meetup.com/EdinbR/) ([EdinbR](http://edinbr.org/)) for several years.
